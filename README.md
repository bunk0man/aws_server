# aws_server
- so I downloaded and installed Ruby and aws-sdk to a Windows system
- I tried my first client-server script in Ruby from an example... (/first_scripts folder)
- I created an aws account but I have some issues with the validation process, now I am looking for a solution
- the problem was solved (there was something wrong with the registration)
- now I created my first aws instance (t2.micro) with ubuntu server
- I created a stop_instance.rb to suspend my server
- I created a start_instance.rb to launch my server
- and I created a create_instance.rb to create same instances if it is needed (I haven't tried yet)
- unfortunately there is some problem with the certification in the scripts (stop_instance.rb, start_instance.rb)
