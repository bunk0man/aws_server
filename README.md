# aws_server
- so I downloaded and installed Ruby to a Windows system
- I executed the 'gem instal aws-sdk' in the cmd to install aws-sdk for Ruby
- I tried my first client-server script in Ruby from an example... Now I am proud of myself, lol...
- I created an aws account but I have some issues with the validation process, now I am looking for a solution
- so the problem was solved (there was something wrong with the registration)
- now I created my first aws instance (t2.micro) with ubuntu server, and trying to create a CLI script that will launch/suspend the server
